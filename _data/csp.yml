Unit1:
  title: Blog Creation w/ Chrissie
  description: In Unit 1, I have learned a lot about basic HTML coding such as working with index.md and config.yml to create changes on my blog. I downloaded many tools such as Jupyter Notebook to read code on my brower and used GitHub to commit changes in my final code that I want to push out of the local server. Eventually, I started learning basic python skills as well as javascript and jquery to code games such as the snake game, calculator. I also looked through notebooks to further code new ideas and edit what I learned onto my posts in my blog.
