description: Learning how to grow from using just HTML to using JavaScript as well. This makes my tables more engaging and formal while showcasing the new styles I have learned. I really enjoy doing sports such as water polo, but I enjoy watching soccer or more known as football.

### Markdown Table
This is how I originally made a table (with Jupyter and HTML) before learning how to make a more complex one. I used the markdown sheet and created a school schedule on my home page using this format. Here's an example:

| Top Men Soccer Athlete | Team | Position | Income | Prized Achievement |
|------|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Cristiano Ronaldo | Al-Nassar FC/Portual | Forward | 200 Million | Ballon d'Or

## HTML Table in Markdown Cell with JavaScript jquery
JavaScript is a programming language that works with HTML data, CSS helps to style that data.  In this example, I mix my skills of JavaScript and CSS to create a more interactive table. 

Some new coding terms:
- The href and src on lines inside of the lines in `<head>` tags; adds other people like 3rd party code to my own page.
- The `<script>` tags at the bottom of the page; generates the interactive table, from the third party code, using the data `<table id="demo">` from the `<body>`.  

<!-- Head contains information to Support the Document -->
<head>
    <!-- load jQuery and DataTables output style and scripts -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.datatables.net/1.13.4/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css">
