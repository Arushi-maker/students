description: Here is my journey of being introduced into the world of VsCode and GitHub. The first thing I did was install all my tools, then I began using my tools to make this blog. After creating the original blog, I started to make it unique and my own with the help of code hacks.

## Beginning

Firstly, I installed VsCode. [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics.de) is where I code everything for the front end and back end.
Every change shows up on my local server. Once I commit changes they show up in GitHub and if anyone were to open my blog they would see this exactly how I want them to.

My Personal GitHub: [Arushi-maker](https://github.com/Arushi-maker)

Then, I created a GitHub account and that is where I create my repositories and find other additional hacks that I have added onto my blog. Additionally, I instaleld Jupyter Notebook to help me edit even more code that is not necessarily html. 

After all the installation, I started creating hacks using hacks I found online and from the sources. I learned how to highlight text, create subpages, add gifs/images, change themes, and even create tables. 

So far the most interactive things on my site are my two projects; [the snake game](http://0.0.0.0:4200/student/2023/08/30/Snake-Game.html) and the [calculator](http://0.0.0.0:4200/student/2023/08/22/Project.html)

I ended up creating more pages on my blog such as blogs on Travel and Projects. I created Travel because that is a big part of my life since I enjoy travelling and have done so for many years. I created the Projects notebook to show off Projects such as the calculator.

I also read through the notebooks on my code such as the Linux Shell and the Psuedo Code ones where I learned about certain commands such as if/then.
