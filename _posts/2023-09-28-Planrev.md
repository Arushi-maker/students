Review Ticket;

> Weekly finished goals

- The first hack I completed was writing in a wireframe in HTML that I can copy/paste anywhere.

- Then I wrote JS code that was displayed in my VsCode console.

- I had trouble with creating a button and swithcing the code.

- I resolved all the errors in the code for last hack and explained what the errors were.

- I commented on my partner's code and worked with them to help make their code better, and make my own better as well.
