    "## My Score:\n",
    "    I scored 46/54 or 85% for the ones that I were able to complete throughout the class time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Journey:\n",
    "\n",
    "    My score improved this trimester from last tri's 81% to this tri's 85%. \n",
    "    Reasons for Improvement:\n",
    "        - Revisions of past problems from old Collegeboard MCQs \n",
    "        - More understanding of concepts such as Pseudo Code and Digital Divide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions Needing Corrections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/7d722d0b-1c8d-4e2a-aae4-a8dccf5996ac)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is 4. 2 is incorrect because the counter increases by one each time before ending at the red space. The counter makes four moves, not two. Collegeboard: The counter is incremented once for each time the game piece moves. The game piece makes four moves before ending in the red space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 9:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/4e6a7bd9-1411-4512-b7c6-a25f3b85ad12)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is B. I got this question incorrect because I did not know what an analog audio signal is. I chose C as my answer; C is incorrect because audio data is not represented digitally, and at the lowest level all digital data is actually represented by sequences of bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 14:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/582855c7-8a16-4f6b-bc55-638ab3f250a8)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is C; Lines 8 and 12 ahould be interchanged. I chose answer choice D; D is incorrect because D would create an infinite loop and in this case \"count\" would not update. However, by changing lines 8 and 12, the count will actually update because return will be false in line 8 before repeating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 16:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/f2b47ca0-4906-45c9-b3c9-883ba7db003f)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is B; Individuals can freely distribute or use the contents of the e-book without needing to obtain additional permissions from the author. I chose choice D; D is incorrect. I chose D because I believed it was the most accurate, and I did not know what a Creative Commons license is. However, now I know with a Creative Commons License the main consequcence is that individuals can use the e-book without needing permission. In fact, D is not typically a consequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 23:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/7afd47cb-8c0e-466b-bb11-1945f1524e3e)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is B; The Internet is designed to scale to support an increasing number of users. I chose choice A. The Internet uses standardized, open communication protocols. I got this wrong because I thought proprietary meant open, but in fact nonproprietary means open. Also, the Internet is able to handle many users at a single time, that is why B is the correct option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 33:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/ced18a90-c400-464b-b176-2d99a390bf2c)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is B; Algorithm II attempts to use an algorithmic approach to solve an otherwise undecidable problem. I chose choice A. I did not chose B because I did not know what heuristic meant. Heuristic: proceeding to a solution by trial and error or by rules that are only loosely defined. When comparing algorithm II with I, algorithm II solves the problem through trial and error to approximate a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 44:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/517b94d1-b0bf-4015-b71b-d50b2d641037)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is B; The account balances are represented using a fixed number of bits, resulting in overflow errors. This is wrong because an overflow occurs when a value exceeds the maximum representable value. This error does not normally have an effect of imprecision of values. The correct answer is resulting in round-off errors. I am still confused about this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 48:\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/assets/75818107/8b8518ae-c98e-4d98-9ffb-d9a6469a8b14)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is A; An unauthorized individual gains the ability to view network traffic by connecting to a network router that uses weak or no security measures. I chose answer C. Answer C is incorrect because answer choice C is actually an example of a phishing attack. This attack does obtain personal information, but it does not allo unauthorized individuals to intercept the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways:\n",
    "After taking the 2021 Practice Exam, I realized I have to practice the abilities of time management and focus. Throughout the exam, I got distracted and had to reread each question two-three times through. I also realized because of this I was only able to complete 54 of the 70 total questions within the given time; with 85% accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these upcoming weeks, I strive to complete many practice tests and problems. I will also review concepts, code, through AP College Board videos and old team teaches from Trimester 1 and 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    " I am satisifed with my score because I have improved from last time I took this Collegeboard MCQ. I strive to do better next time, and implement the new knowledge into my test-taking skills. I will need to review some of these problems again, and concepts such as the legal/ethical factors of computing, and using an algorithm. I will also do more practice exams to strengthen my weaker focusing skills and time managment skills. This was overall a good benchmark exam for self-evaluation.\n"
