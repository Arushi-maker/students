    "The main focus of our website is to analyze the mental state of users and help them release stress using some simple small games and journaling. Some features within the site include a zen garden (imitation of bubble popping), a breathe feature, a memory game, a daily log, a mental health questionare, 2048 game, ping pong game, and blog posts. Some of these incorporate real diagnosis such as the daily log and blog posts.\n",
