    "\n",
    "The main focus of our website is to analyze the mental state of users and help them release stress using some simple small games and journaling. Some features within the site include a zen garden (imitation of bubble popping), a breathe feature, a memory game, a daily log, a mental health questionare, 2048 game, ping pong game, and blog posts. Some of these incorporate real diagnosis such as the daily log and blog posts.\n",

    "I worked on the introduction to the team mental health website. This includes the basic transition and animation in the html.\n",

    "One of the main features I worked on in the website was the Ping Pong game, written in Javascript. This game is supposed to release anxiety and give a sense of fullfillment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, I worked with my teammate on Daily Logs. This is where users can type in how they feel and get a diagnosis. The response is generated using ChatGPT.\n",

    "\n",
    "I followed some of the college board big ideas which are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Creative development\n",
    "    - Organization through google docs, github issues, and planning in notebooks\n",
    "    - Desgin aspects through Canva, vscode styles, SASS, and CSS\n",
    "    - Variety of images such as koala theme\n",
    " 2. Data\n",
    "    - Researching topic of mental health \n",
    "    - Taking notes on different games that will be beneficial to incorporate into the site\n",
    " 3. Algorithms and Programing\n",
    "    - Usage of JavaScript, Python, and HTML coding\n",
    "    - Connecting a Frontend and Backend w/ fetch code\n",
    "    - Basic games \n",
    " 4. Computer Systems\n",
    " 5. Impact of Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be going through each of them and how they are tied into our project. I also went through a couple collegeboard units to create this project this trimester including Big Idea 1, Big Idea 2, and Big Idea 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout the whole trimester, I've realized that **collaboration** is a BIG aspect in coding. Although, you code your own part, you are esssentially working towards a whole team. You are a small part of a bigger team, so not everything depends on you, but enough does depend on you. Working with agile, helped the process of collaboration combine with efficieny to produce a great outcome. Looking back, this trimester really flew by fast, but I am enjoying this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "I faced many struggles which as I learned, I was able to overcome them such as committing issues, technical issues, image issues, and etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am looking forward to learning more about backend such as usage of APIs to store data and to be able to learn more frontend features to make the designs I code more original and efficient. \n",
