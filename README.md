## A journey through AP Computer Science Principles

Hello, welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my experience with the AP Computer Science Principles course I'm currently enrolled in. This course is a comprehensive full year course. What's even more fascinating is that it's not just the educators who shape the course content; students like myself have the opportunity to contribute and be recognized as authors for the content we help create.

My personal website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which offers an incredibly convenient and integrated platform for managing our web content. GitHub employs a tool called Jekyll to transform our content into static websites and blogs.
